## Who I am

<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d4ce863d23886ec67558ffe4309fe76.png" class="right" />

I am an [INFJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html). I am an Achiever, Activator, Futuristic, Ideation, Input.

At the moment I live in Germany and work as a Consultant for [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com/).

I like pushing new ideas and forward thinking in the areas of DevOps and infrastructure automation. That's one of the reasons why I've created DevOps Meetups in nearly every city I've lived in:

1. [Singapore](http://www.meetup.com/devops-singapore/)
1. [Bangkok](http://www.meetup.com/de/DevOps-Bangkok/)
1. [Phnom Penh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1508055822791148/)
1. [Hamburg](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Hamburg/)
1. [Frankfurt](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Frankfurt/)

<small>(the other reason is that it's fun to meet amazing people)</small>

I organised several DevOpsDays conferences in Singapore:

1. <https://devopsdays.org/events/2017-singapore/contact>
1. <https://devopsdays.org/events/2016-singapore>
1. <https://legacy.devopsdays.org/events/2015-singapore/>

(devopsdays is a worldwide community conference series for anyone interested in IT improvement.)

I believe in developers taking over responsibility for their work especially in production and that they can work well together with operations (and vice versa).

I truly believe that delivering software is a team sport and that it can be great fun.

## What I do

The blunt version: I love to document and clean up so called "messy" projects.

I support teams that are stuck in legacy code base nobody wants to touch.

I used test-driven strategies to refactor code in order to make it easier to understand and maintain.

Most of the time that includes converting legacy scripts to Infrastructure-As-Code, writing specs for `black box` systems for example and - more often than not - remove a bunch of code.

Over the years I enable teams to support large variety of legacy code bases, establish continuous integration routines and increase test coverage and ultimately confidence.

I never ceases to impress me how impactful Continuous Integration, Build Pipelines and Continuous Delivery are on teams spirits.

## My punchline

When I hear 'impossible' it gets interesting.
