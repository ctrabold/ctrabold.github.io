## Who I am

<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d4ce863d23886ec67558ffe4309fe76.png" class="right" />

I am an [INFJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html). I am an Achiever, Activator, Futuristic, Ideation, Input.

At the moment I am living in Singapore helping to spread the word over _Continuous Delivery_ and _DevOps_ for [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com/).

I like pushing new ideas and forward thinking in the areas of DevOps and infrastructure automation. That's one of the reasons why I've created DevOps Meetups in nearly every city I've lived in:

- [Frankfurt](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Frankfurt/)
- [Hamburg](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Hamburg/)
- [Phnom Penh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1508055822791148/)
- [Singapore](http://www.meetup.com/devops-singapore/)
- [Bangkok](http://www.meetup.com/de/DevOps-Bangkok/)

<small>(the other reason is that it's fun to meet amazing people)</small>

I believe in developers taking over responsibility for their work in production and that they can work well together with operations (and vice versa).

I truly believe that delivering software is a team sport and that it can be great fun.


# What I do

The blunt version: I love to document and clean up messy projects.

I've mainly worked in supporting teams that were stuck in their legacy code base.

I used test-driven strategies to refactor their chef and puppet repositories in order to make them easier to understand and maintain.

That includes converting legacy shell scripts to chef-recipes and writing specs for `black box` systems for example.

Over the years, I've enabled teams to support their large variety of legacy code bases, to use continuous integration and to increase their test coverage and confidence.

All the way from Continuous Integration, through scalable Build Pipelines to Continuous Delivery.


## My punchline

When I hear 'impossible' it gets interesting.

## Open Source

I have a number of open-source projects hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ctrabold/).

Most of the work happens as a maintainer / contributor of several Organizations though.
