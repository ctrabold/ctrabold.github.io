## Who I am

<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d4ce863d23886ec67558ffe4309fe76.png" class="right" />

I am an INFJ. I am an Achiever, Activator, Futuristic, Ideation, Input.

At the moment I am travelling in South East Asia helping to spread the word over _Continuous Delivery_.

Before that I worked for several companies as a Consultant, e.g. for [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com/), helping customers implement Continuous Delivery.

I like pushing new ideas and forward thinking in the areas of DevOps and infrastructure automation.

That's one reason why I created the DevOps Meetups in [Frankfurt](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Frankfurt/) and [Hamburg](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Hamburg/) <small>(the other reason is that it's fun)</small>.

I believe in developers taking over responsibility for their work in production and that they can play well with operations (and vice versa).

I truely believe that delivering software is a teamsport and that it can be great fun.


# What I do

The blunt version? I love to document and clean up messy projects.

I've mainly worked in supporting teams that were stuck in their legacy code base.

I used test-driven strategies to refactor their chef and puppet repositories in order to make them easier to understand and maintain.

That includes converting legacy shell scripts to chef-recipes and writing specs for `black box` systems for example.

Over the years, I've enabled teams to support their large variety of legacy code bases, to use continuous integration and to increase their test coverage and confidence.

All the way from Continuous Integration, through scalable Build Pipelines to Continuous Delivery.


## My punchline

When I hear 'impossible' it get's interesting.

## Open Source

I have a number of open-source projects hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ctrabold/).

Most of the work happens as a maintainer / contributor of several [Organizations](https://github.com/typo3-ci) though.

I'm also a proud member of the [TYPO3 Server Admin Team](https://typo3.org/teams/server-team/) and initiator of [ci.typo3.org](https://ci.typo3.org) and [metrics.typo3.org](https://metrics.typo3.org) â€“ the CI and Code Metrics-Server for [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/), an Open Source Content Management System.
