... everything is allright and xmas is ON! :)

If you wonder why I'm so quiet: It's because there is SO MUCH happening!

The last months have been intense, full of wonders and fantastic!

I am planning more post to describe some of the amazing things that happened this year.

In the meantime you can [explore Phnom Penh online](https://www.google.com/maps/views/streetview/cambodia-highlights?gl=us) :)

I wish you Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year _full of wonders_!

May all your wishes come true!

Christian
