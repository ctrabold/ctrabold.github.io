## Lesson learned

I can not escape from something I like.
I built the CI environment in order to provide a better QA environment.
In my eyes we can improve quite a lot of areas in quality and make TYPO3 shine in areas never experienced before.

If testing is hard, the software design is to complicated.
Well, everybody knows that TYPO3 is a grown system.

When do you start taking care of your users and start verifiing that releases are stable?
Shorter RC cycles for example. Confidence during development.
Confiedence when patching security holes. CI with Zaproxy with ZEP scripts. regressions.

I recognized I can not do it alone. No financial profit nor fun.


## My Vision for TYPO3

Set new standards in QA: fully covered by automated UAT and regression tests
Quick insights for Code Quality for core and extensions / packages
provide feedback for developers on extension upload
make extension and community exploration fun and delightful
provide metrics dashboard for typo3 community managers and participants the like
I often got questions how to start contributing / supporting me. My blunt answer on this is: I don't know. Maybe sometimes you see the bigger picture or not. It's impossible to explain each and everybody what big pictures I have in mind but rather keep on looking for people that share the same pictures without losing hours and hours of talking.

I sincerely hoped that I could spread the ideas through my talks at T3DD and T3CONs.

I learn to enjoy talking in front of people.

I am involved in TYPO3 for many years. After switching jobs I considered me off TYPO3 but I quickly learned that being a member of an open source community is a bigger thing.

Much bigger than I though.

This is regardless of how great TYPO3 is as a software. I often hear people complain about TYPO3… and they usually complain about much more things.

I like this quote on that: Life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful.

Working for OSS gives purpose in life. It is valuable in time and social terms.

Hacking my first lines of extension code at mehrwert. Initializing the first UG in Cologne WANTING to meet other TYPO3 heads just to see other like minded people.
Joining dkd. Rocking TYPO3 with some of the most brilliant minds I know.

Writing the things I've learned down to a book. Selected best practices. That is Landing an O'Reilly best seller in Germany folks! Man was I excited.

Writing a book gives you a damn good impression how quickly a software project moves.

An hell TYPO3 develops fast! Second edition of the book was a complete re-write. Great to see so many contributions in a good direction.
