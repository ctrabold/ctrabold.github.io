# Christian Trabold Blog

This is the Jekyll source for Christian Trabold's blog.

It uses the stylish Solar Theme made by [Matt Harzewski](http://www.webmaster-source.com/) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blogs, based on the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette (which I use everywhere).
